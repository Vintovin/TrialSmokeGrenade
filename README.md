<h1> Demonstration Repo </h1>

<p>This was a simple project to test my ability in Roblox Studio.

The project was to make a simple smoke grenade system within 12 hours of the task being sent out.

The model for the smoke grenade was provided, but nothing else was given.
</p>
This project was split into 5 parts:

  * Local Handler
  * Server Handler
  * Configuration
  * Animation
  * Virtual Space Model

<h2> Local Handler</h2>

The local handler focuses on 2 things

  * Tracking the tool status
  * Tracking User Input

This can be seen in LocalHandler.lua in the project file

<h2> Server Handler</h2>

The Server Handler was responsible for the following:

  * All Server-Wide changes
  * Animations
  * Welds/Vector Positioning
  * Smoke effects
  * Clearing and removing the smoke

This can be seen in ServerHandler.lua in the project file

<h2> Configuration </h2>

The configuration just targeted certain variables which are planned to be interchangable and simple to adapt.
This allowed for a large range of customisability for the end user.

This can be seen in the config.lua file in the project file

<h2> Animation </h2>

The animation end of this was completed using the Roblox Animation Editor

The Final animation can be viewed **[here](https://gyazo.com/b21e04980dbae6d2584233b0bdd79938)**

<h2> Virtual Space Modeling </h2>

A meshed and textured model was provided by the customer, and used for this demonstration


All physics elements of the system were orientated around the *[BodyForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyForce)* object.
